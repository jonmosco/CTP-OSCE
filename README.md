### CTP and OSCE practice

Practice and scripts used during CTP course to prepare for the OSCE exam.

#### Vulnserver

I used the awesome Vulnserver to do a lot of my practice.  The exercises
for CTP seemed to transfer over here nicely so I took advantage of this
code.

* gmon
  * SEH
  * Egghunters

#### Exploits

I found a few exploits on exploit-db to redo for practice as well and
documented them here.

#### Notes

These notes are mostly here so I can remember what the heck i'm doing since
no one person has the brain capacity to store all this in his/her head at
one time.

Metasploit pattern creation and offset calculation are now standalone tools:

```bash
msf-pattern_offset
msf-pattern_create
```
